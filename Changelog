xinput_calibrator 0.6.0 [2010-02-15]
Major features:
* switch to autotools based build system (Petr Štetiar)
* add -v option, prints debug messages
* add --list option, lists calibratable devices
* add support for --device option, selects a specific device
* Add a manpage

Minor features:
* make it compile with strict flags (Petr Štetiar)
* Load font fixed when 9x15 fails in GuiCalibratorX11 (Marco Cavallini)
* add support for specific device id for evdev (necessary when 2 devices have the same name)
* xorg print: clean up output and added udev rule
* evdev: print ways to make config permanent (easier when evdev >= 2.3.0)
* scripts/xinput_calibrator.desktop a sample .desktop file
* scripts/xinput_calibrator_pointercal.sh script to make the changes permanent
(xinput is called with every Xorg start)

Bug fixes/enhancements:
* fix double free in evdev calibrator (reported by Marco Cavallini)
* Check that XInput >= 1.5 in evdev calibrator (reported by Marcin Juszkiewicz)
* check that the device is a XI_TOUCHSCREEN
* set evdev calibration to default when none is apparently set (fixes sleep/resume quirk)
* swap_xy in dynamic evdev: unswap if already swapped
